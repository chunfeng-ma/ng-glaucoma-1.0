      <b>Glaucoma</b> is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss.
      The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma
      and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side
      vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle
      glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred
      vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred,
      is permanent.

      Risk factors for glaucoma include increased pressure in the eye, a family history of the condition, migraines,
      high blood pressure, and obesity. For eye pressures a value of greater than 21 mmHg or 2.8 kPa is often used
      with higher pressures leading to a greater risk.However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never
      develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma.

    <p>
      About 6 to 67 million people have glaucoma globally. It occurs more commonly among older people.
      Closed-angle glaucoma is more common in women.Glaucoma has been called the "silent thief of sight" because
      the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a longperiod of time. Worldwide, glaucoma is the second-leading
      cause of blindness after cataracts.
